In general, consider the questions
- What aren't we testing?
- What are we testing?
- How are we testing it?

1) WTFServer
  
  Can you have a negative port?
  - Will automatically go to 65535.

  Can you have letters as a port?
  - Will automatically go to 0. 

2) WTFClient
  

  We plan to configure to a server, add files to repo, add them to .manifest.
Remove files from the repo/.mani and run update, with the .update file run 
Commit/Push run Upgrade, then run Commit/Push once more.

3) What we're not testing

  
  Does commit work?

  Does push work?

  Does rollback work?
